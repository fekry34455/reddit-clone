# Reddit Clone Rebuild

This repo scaffolds an Express + Prisma + Postgres backend for the Reddit clone while keeping the UI in a Next.js frontend (to be integrated in `frontend/`).

## Structure
- `backend/` — Express API with Prisma schema and Postgres configuration.

## Next steps
1. Add the existing Next.js UI under `frontend/`.
2. Wire the UI to the new API endpoints.
3. Expand the API routes for posts, comments, and subreddit features.
